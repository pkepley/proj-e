# proj-e
This repository contains some worked solutions to Project Euler
problems. Most of the solutions in this repository are written in
Python, but I've been thinking about adding some solutions in Julia
and C (as I've recently been learning Julia and have been re-learning
C).

I wrote most of my Python solutions back in 2014-2015 when I was just
beginning to learn Python. At the time, I didn't know git, had no idea
about proper linting, and was just barely able to make things run in
Python 2. So I've recently been updating them (slowly) to run in
Python3 and trying to clean them up / document them better. Maybe I'll
even add unit tests. I dunno (:
