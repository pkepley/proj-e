This repository contains some worked solutions to Project Euler
problems. Most of the solutions I have in this repository were written
in Python, but I've recently been thinking about adding solutions in
Julia and C (as I recently started learning Julia, and have been
re-learning C).

I wrote most of my Python solutions back in 2014-2015 when I was just
beginning to learn Python. At the time, I didn't know git, was
unwaware of the existence of linteres, and was only barely able to
make things run in Python 2. So I have recently been (slowly) updating
my solutions to run in Python3 and trying to clean them up / document
them better. Maybe I'll even add unit tests at some point. I dunno! ðŸ™‚

Checking the number of solutions in my Python folder against the
number of solutions displayed in the image below should give a sense
of how many more solutions I have left to incorporate into this
repository:
